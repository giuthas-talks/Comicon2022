# Borrowing a Language 101 and Ideas for Fantastic ((un)real) Speech

Two talks I gave at Indiana Comicon in April 2022. These have since evolved 
and been part of the program at Ropecon in at least 
[2022 (slides in English)](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Ropecon2022) 
and [2023 (slides in Finnish)](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Ropecon2023):

- [Borrowing a language 101 [pdf]](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Comicon2022/blob/main/Borrowing/borrowing_a_language.pdf)
  was my first take on the question of what all needs to be considered when borrowing an existing
  language for a fictional setting, and
- [Ideas for Fantastic ((un)real) Speech [pdf]](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Comicon2022/blob/main/Unreal/ideas_for_fantastic_speech.pdf)
  was my first take on how to generate
  interesting material for a fantasy setting by selectively applying constraints of the world itself,
  speech science -- especially articulation, because this is me -- and needs of the story.

where the Comicon took place (Indianapolis).
